# University of Bristol Applied Deep Learning project (Music Genre Classification using Convolutional Neural Network) 
# About the project
This project aims to replicate 2 different Convolutional Neural Network architectures from a proposed research paper to perform music genre classification. The detailed project description can be found in the CW_spec.pdf file. The model accuracy was then improved by implementing recurrent layers to the network architecture. Our approach and implementing/improving process are written in detail in the ADL_Report.pdf file.
